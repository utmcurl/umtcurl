GENERAL

The scripts in this directory are created so I can test a proxy created by a colleague.
By using scripts I don't have to do it manualy all the time.
Due to the lack of (finding) programms that fit my needs I decided to created something myself.

It uses simple shell scripting to manage the testing.
The scripts simply calls curl and curl-loader.

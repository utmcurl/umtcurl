GENERAL

The scripts in this directory are created so I can test a proxy created by a colleague.
By using scripts I don't have to do it manualy all the time.
Due to the lack of (finding) programms that fit my needs I decided to created something myself.

It uses simple shell scripting to manage the testing.
The scripts simply calls curl and curl-loader.

FUNCTIONS

Making requests to the proxy
Making a lot of requests to the proxy (stress testing)
Making bogus requests to test if the proxy reacts nicely
Log all the requests and the results
Create test suites by changing the extention to .active or .inactive

REQUIREMENTS

Linux shell (bash or ...)
curl
curl-loader

USAGE

sh main.sh [directory with test files] [path to exectuable] #Loops through all files in the specified directory

Create a test file simply by making an sh script BUT make the EXTENSION of the file .active

A test file is included, here's the code:

---test.active---
#! /bin/sh

echo "STARTED: "$0
echo "I DO NOTHING"
echo "ENDED: "$0 ($SECONDS seconds)
